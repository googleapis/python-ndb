def orchestrate(*tests, **kwargs):
    """
    Orchestrate a deterministic concurrency test.

    Runs test functions in separate threads, with each thread taking turns running up
    until predefined syncpoints in a deterministic order. All possible orderings are
    tested.

    Most of the time, we try to use logic, best practices, and static analysis to insure
    correct operation of concurrent code. Sometimes our powers of reasoning fail us and,
    either through non-determistic stress testing or running code in production, a
    concurrent bug is discovered. When this occurs, we'd like to have a regression test
    to insure we've understood the problem and implemented a correct solution.
    `orchestrate` provides a means of deterministically testing concurrent code so we
    can write robust regression tests for complex concurrent scenarios.

    `orchestrate` runs each passed in test function in its own thread. Threads then
    "take turns" running. Turns are defined by setting syncpoints in the code under
    test, using comment containing "pragma: SYNCPOINT". `orchestrate` will scan the code
    under test and add syncpoints where it finds these comments.

    For example, let's say you have the following code in production::

        def hither_and_yon(destination):
            hither(destination)
            yon(destination)

    You've found there's a concurrency bug when two threads execute this code with the
    same destination, and you think that by adding a syncpoint between the calls to
    `hither` and `yon` you can reproduce the problem in a regression test. First add a
    comment with "pragma: SYNCPOINT" to the code under test::

        def hither_and_yon(destination):
            hither(destination)   # pragma: SYNCPOINT
            yon(destination)

    When testing with orchestrate, there will now be a syncpoint, or a pause, after the
    call to `hither` and before the call to `yon`. Now you can write a test to exercise
    `hither_and_yon` running in parallel::

        from unittest import mock
        from tests.unit import orchestrate

        from google.cloud.sales import travel

        @mock.patch("google.cloud.sales.travel._syncpoint_123", orchestrate.syncpoint)
        def test_concurrent_hither_and_yon():

            def test_hither_and_yon():
                assert something
                travel.hither_and_yon("Raleigh")
                assert something_else

            counts = orchestrate.orchestrate(test_hither_and_yon, test_hither_and_yon)
            assert counts == (2, 2)

    What `orchestrate` will do now is take each of the two test functions passed in
    (actually the same function, twice, in this case), run them serially, and count the
    number of turns it takes to run each test to completion. In this example, it will
    take two turns for each test: one turn to start the thread and execute up until the
    syncpoint, and then another turn to execute from the syncpoint to the end of the
    test. The number of turns will always be one greater than the number of syncpoints
    encountered when executing the test.

    Once the counts have been taken, `orchestrate` will construct a test sequence that
    represents all of the turns taken by the passed in tests, with each value in the
    sequence representing the index of the test whose turn it is in the sequence. In
    this example, then, it would produce::

        [0, 0, 1, 1]

    This represents the first test taking both of its turns, followed by the second test
    taking both of its turns. At this point this scenario has already been tested,
    because this is what was run to produce the counts and the initial test sequence.
    Now `orchestrate` will run all of the remaining scenarios by finding all the
    permutations of the test sequence and executing those, in turn::

        [0, 1, 0, 1]
        [0, 1, 1, 0]
        [1, 0, 0, 1]
        [1, 0, 1, 0]
        [1, 1, 0, 0]

    You'll notice in our example that since both test functions are actually the same
    function, that although it tested 6 scenarios there are effectively only really 3
    unique scenarios. For the time being, though, `orchestrate` doesn't attempt to
    detect this condition or optimize for it.

    There are some performance considerations that should be taken into account when
    writing tests. The number of unique test sequences grows quite quickly with the
    number of turns taken by the functions under test. Our simple example with two
    threads each taking two turns, only yielded 6 scenarios, but two threads each taking
    6 turns, for example, yields 924 scenarios. Add another six step thread and now you
    have over 17 thousand scenarios. In general, use the least number of steps/threads
    you can get away with and still expose the behavior you want to correct.

    For the same reason as above, its recommended that if you have many concurrent
    tests, that you name your syncpoints so that you're not accidentally using
    syncpoints intended for other tests, as this will add steps to your tests. While
    it's not problematic from a testing standpoint to have extra steps in your tests, it
    can use computing resources unnecessarily. A name can be added to any syncpoint
    after the `SYNCPOINT` keyword in the pragma definition::

        def hither_and_yon(destination):
            hither(destination)   # pragma: SYNCPOINT hither and yon
            yon(destination)

    In your test, then, pass that name to `orchestrate` to cause it to use only
    syncpoints with that name::

        orchestrate.orchestrate(
            test_hither_and_yon, test_hither_and_yon, name="hither and yon"
        )

    As soon as any error or failure is detected, no more scenarios are run
    and that error is propagated to the main thread.

    One limitation of `orchestrate` is that it cannot really be used with `coverage`,
    since both tools use `sys.set_trace`. Any code that needs verifiable test coverage
    should have additional tests that do not use `orchestrate`, since code that is run
    under orchestrate will not show up in a coverage report generated by `coverage`.

            unnamed syncpoints will be used.

    Returns:

            used a sanity check in tests to make sure you understand what's actually
            happening during a test.
